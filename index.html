    <h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life :</h3>


    <p><strong>. 1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, lowa</p>
    <p> <strong> . 1933</strong> -Leaves his family's farm to attend the Universiy of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression
      era program known
      as
      the "National Youth Administration" </p>
    <p><strong>. 1935 </strong>- Has to stop school and save up money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping
      starving
      Americains."I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</p>
    <p><strong>. 1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</p>
    <p><strong>. 1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budjet cuts. Inspired by
      Elvin Charles
      Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</p>
    <p><strong>. 1941 </strong>- Tries to enroll in the military after the Ã«arl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead,
      the military
      asked his lab to worl on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</p>
    <p><strong>. 1942 </strong>- Receives a Ph.D in Genetics and Plant Pathology</p>
    <p><strong>. 1944 </strong>- reject a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies
      to Mexico to head
      a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease
      resistent what - including different varieties for each ajor climate on Earth.</p>
    <p> <strong> . 1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twoce each season, doubling wheat yields</p>
    <p><strong> . 1953 </strong>- crosses a shot, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American reed,
      creating a strain that
      responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</p>
    <p> <strong>. 1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontient
      in time to help
      mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</p>
    <p> <strong> . 1970 </strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</p>
  </section>
  <p> <strong> . 1983 </strong>- helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields</p>
  <p><strong> . 1984 </strong>- becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</p>
  <p> <strong> . 2005 </strong>- states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically
    modified crops are
    the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous
    because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, were
    selecting the best breeds."</p>
  <p> <strong> . 2009 </strong>- dies at the age of 95</p>

  <p id="italique"> <i> "Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching contribution that one man's
      towering
      intellect,
      persistence and scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."</i>
